Birth Control and medication tips
Family planning using a woman's menstrual cycle is often referred to as 
"Natural Family Planning" (NFP) or the "Fertility Awareness Method" (FAM). 
It involves tracking a woman's menstrual cycle and identifying fertile and 
infertile days to either achieve or avoid pregnancy.

It's important to note that Natural Family Planning can be effective when used correctly, 
but it requires regular tracking, consistency, and abstinence or protection during fertile days. 
It may not be as reliable as other birth control methods. Here are some considerations:
Effectiveness: The effectiveness of NFP depends on the accuracy of tracking and the regularity of the woman's cycle. When used correctly, it can be 76-88% effective.
 

*Healthcare Provider: It's advisable to consult a healthcare provider or fertility specialist to learn NFP techniques and get guidance.

*Personal Commitment: Success with NFP also depends on the personal commitment of the couple.

*Not Protection Against STDs: NFP does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Couples engaging in sexual activity should consider this and use additional protection if necessary.

**App and Technology: Some couples use mobile apps and technology to track and predict fertility. These tools can help improve accuracy.
